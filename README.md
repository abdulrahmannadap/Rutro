### 3. **Add a README File**
Include detailed instructions in the `README.md` file to help contributors set up and understand the project. The description I provided earlier can be used as the base.

---

### 4. **Define Issues and Features**
- Use GitHub Issues to define tasks, bugs, or features you want contributors to work on.
- Add labels like `good first issue`, `help wanted`, or `bug` to make it easier for others to pick tasks.

---

### 5. **Add a Code of Conduct**
Include a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file to set the tone for collaboration. GitHub provides a [Code of Conduct template](https://github.com/github/opensource.guide/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

---

### 6. **Set Up Branch Protection Rules**
- Go to **Settings > Branches > Branch protection rules**.
- Protect the `main` branch to ensure that changes are only merged via pull requests.
- Require at least one review before merging pull requests.

---

### 7. **Add a License (Optional)**
If you decide to add a license later, choose a permissive license like MIT to encourage contributions. Without a license, others may hesitate to contribute.

---

### 8. **Communicate Expectations**
- Use the repositoryâ€™s **Discussions** feature to talk about ideas and get feedback.
- Add a pinned issue or discussion explaining how people can get involved.

Let me know if you need help creating any specific files or setting up the repository further!
